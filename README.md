# Serenity BDD and MS Playwright

This tutorial show you how to get started with REST-API testing using Serenity and Cucumber 4. 



### The project directory structure
The project has build scripts for both Maven and Gradle, and follows the standard directory structure used in most Serenity projects:
```Gherkin
src
  + main
  + test
    + java                                Test runners and supporting code
    + resources
      + features                          Feature filesâ€¨
          + status
          + trades
             record_a_new_trade.feature 
      + templates                         Freemarker templates and properties files                

```
